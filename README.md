## 🛌 About My Life Philosophy

This is SkyHargon. I'm planning to learn how to use Github and how to write codes. 
But it's just a plan, I'm not sure I will really do it. Because I have had this plan in 2023, 
but so far, I have not done it in any way or done any things for it. 
Yep, I'm lazy, lazy and lazy. What will be will be in the future? I don't know. 
And now, I'm going to sleep. Sleep is the most important part of my life!!
